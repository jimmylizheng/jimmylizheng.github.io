    <p>Hi! I'm Zheng Li. Currently, I'm a senior student majoring in <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a
            href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>. My research interest lies in Computer
        Network, Mobile Computing, 
        Machine Learning, and Human Computer Interaction. At University of Michigan, I'm fortunate to work as a research
        assistant in RobustNet Lab led by Professor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/">Z. Morley Mao</a> and
        SODA Lab
        led by Professor <a href="https://jiasi.engin.umich.edu/">Jiasi Chen</a>. I'm also pursuing a <a
            href="https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/ipo/study-abroad/degree-programs/">dual degree</a> of <a
            href="https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/undergraduate-program/degrees-programs/electrical-and-computer-engineering/">Electrical
            and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, where I
        worked
        closely with Professor <a href="https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/pradeep_bio.html">Pradeep
            Ray</a>
        in the <a href="https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/about.html">Center for Entrepreneurship</a>. Click here to view my

    <h2>Fun</h2>
    <p>Some of my other interests (outside of research!):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Travelling: I love travelling to different places and meeting different people and culture. I've been to
            more than
            half of the provinces in China (about 20).</li>
        <li>Beetle: I've been breeding beetles for more than 10 years and I also have the experience of breeding
            reptiles.</li>
        <li>Running: I'm a runner and I've won several medals in Man's 1500m and 800m back in high school days.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My hometown is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhou">Wenzhou</a>, a city located at east of China. It
        is
        known as the cradle of mathematicians.</p>

    <p>I did Physics and Mathematical Olympiad in high school.</p>
