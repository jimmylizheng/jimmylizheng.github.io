Hi! I'm Zheng Li. Currently I'm a senior student majoring in Computer Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interest lies in Computer Network, Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction. At University of Michigan, I'm fortunate to work as a research assistant in RobustNet Lab led by Professor [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/) and SODA Lab led by Professor [Jiasi Chen](https://jiasi.engin.umich.edu/). I'm also pursuing a dual degree of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I worked closely with Professor [Pradeep Ray](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/pradeep_bio.html) in the [Center for Entrepreneurship](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/about.html).

# Fun

Some of my other interests (outside of research!):

Beetle: I've been breeding beetles for more than 10 years and I also have the experience of breeding reptiles.

Running: I'm a runner and I've won severl medals in Man's 1500m and 800m back in high school days.

My hometown is Wenzhou, a city located at east of China. It is known as the cradle of mathematicians.
