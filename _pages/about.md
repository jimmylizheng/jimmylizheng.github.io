Hi! I'm Zheng Li. Currently I'm a senior student majoring in [Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). My research interest lies in Computer Network, Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction. At University of Michigan, I'm fortunate to work as a research assistant in RobustNet Lab led by Professor [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/) and SODA Lab led by Professor [Jiasi Chen](https://jiasi.engin.umich.edu/). I'm also pursuing a [dual degree](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/ipo/study-abroad/degree-programs/) of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/undergraduate-program/degrees-programs/electrical-and-computer-engineering/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I worked closely with Professor [Pradeep Ray](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/pradeep_bio.html) in the [Center for Entrepreneurship](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/about.html).
