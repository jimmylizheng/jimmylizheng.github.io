Hi! I'm Zheng Li. Currently I'm a senior student majoring in Computer Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interest lies in Computer Network, Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction. At University of Michigan, I'm fortunate to work as a research assistant in RobustNet Lab led by Professor [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/) and SODA Lab led by Professor [Jiasi Chen](https://jiasi.engin.umich.edu/). I'm also pursuing a dual degree of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I worked closely with Professor [Pradeep Ray](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/pradeep_bio.html) in the [Center for Entrepreneurship](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/about.html).

# Selected Project

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

## Site-wide configuration

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [\_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [\_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
