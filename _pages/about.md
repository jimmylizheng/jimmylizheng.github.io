Hi! I'm Zheng Li. Currently I'm a senior student majoring in [Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). My research interest lies in Computer Network, Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction. At University of Michigan, I'm fortunate to work as a research assistant in RobustNet Lab led by Professor [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/) and SODA Lab led by Professor [Jiasi Chen](https://jiasi.engin.umich.edu/). I'm also pursuing a [dual degree](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/ipo/study-abroad/degree-programs/) of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/undergraduate-program/degrees-programs/electrical-and-computer-engineering/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I worked closely with Professor [Pradeep Ray](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/pradeep_bio.html) in the [Center for Entrepreneurship](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/entrepreneurship/views/about.html).

# Selected Project

1. **Emotion Classifier for Reddit Post**

   Trained machine learning model to classify the emotions in Reddit posts.

   Did feature engineering and used several different machine learning classifiers including LinearSVM, QuadraticSVM etc. to improve classification correctness. Finally improved the accuracy by 10% compared with the original basic LinearSVM model.

1. **Dog Classifier**

   Trained machine learning model to classify different dog breeds.

   Used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping to visualize features used by CNN.

   Applied transfer learning and data augmentation to improve classification correctness. Finally improved the accuracy by 12% compared with the original CNN model.

1. **MiProxy**

   Built a Proxy that can handle video streaming requirements between multiple clients and servers.

   Implemented adaptive bitrate selections for video streaming to minimize annoying buffering and improve user experience.

   Realized distance based server selection using Dijkstra algorithm.

1. **Static Router**

   Implemented a static router with basic router function like packet forwarding.

   Implemented layer 2 and layer 3 protocols including ARP, ICMP, Ethernet etc.

1. **SillyQL: A Simplified Query Language**

   Implemented a program that support basic SQL commands including insert, select, join, where etc.

   Used hash map and binary searching tree to accelerate some commands' execution.

1. **Insta485: A Simulation Program for Instagram**

   Implemented a static site generator that can automatically produce HTML templates for static web pages.

   Implemented an Instagram clone that has basic Instagram functions with server-side and client-side dynamic pages.

1. **Map - Reduce Searching Engin**

   Created a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs.

   Built an Index server, a REST API app that returns search results in JSON format.

   Built a scalable Search server with a user interface that returns search results like Google or Bing.

# Fun

Some of my other interests (outside of research!):

Travelling: I love travelling to different places and meeting different people and culture. I've been to more than half of the provinces in China (about 20).

Beetle: I've been breeding beetles for more than 10 years and I also have the experience of breeding reptiles.

Running: I'm a runner and I've won severl medals in Man's 1500m and 800m back in high school days.

My hometown is [Wenzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhou), a city located at east of China. It is known as the cradle of mathematicians.

I did Physics and Mathematical Olympiad in high school.
