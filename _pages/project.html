        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented a static router with basic router function like packet forwarding so that it will be able to route
                real
                packets to HTTP servers.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented layer 2 and layer 3 protocols including ARP, ICMP, Ethernet etc.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implemented a program that supports basic SQL commands including insert, select, join, where etc.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used hash map and binary searching tree to accelerate some commands' execution.

            <strong>Emotion Classifier for Reddit Post</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Trained machine learning model to classify the emotions in Reddit posts.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Did feature engineering and used several different machine learning classifiers including LinearSVM,
                    QuadraticSVM
                    etc. to improve classification correctness. Finally improved the accuracy by 10% compared with the original
                    basic
                    LinearSVM model.
