    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Emotion Classifier for Reddit Post</strong><br>
            Trained machine learning model to classify the emotions in Reddit posts.<br>
            Did feature engineering and used several different machine learning classifiers including LinearSVM,
            QuadraticSVM
            etc. to improve classification correctness. Finally improved the accuracy by 10% compared with the original
            basic
            LinearSVM model.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dog Classifier</strong><br>
            Trained machine learning model to classify different dog breeds.<br>
            Used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping to visualize features used by CNN.<br>
            Applied transfer learning and data augmentation to improve classification correctness. Finally improved the
            accuracy by 12% compared with the original CNN model.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MiProxy</strong><br>
            Built a Proxy that can handle video streaming requirements between multiple clients and servers.<br>
            Implemented adaptive bitrate selections for video streaming to minimize annoying buffering and improve user
            experience.<br>
            Realized distance-based server selection using Dijkstra algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Static Router</strong><br>
            Implemented a static router with basic router function like packet forwarding.<br>
            Implemented layer 2 and layer 3 protocols including ARP, ICMP, Ethernet etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SillyQL: A Simplified Query Language</strong><br>
            Implemented a program that supports basic SQL commands including insert, select, join, where etc.<br>
            Used hash map and binary searching tree to accelerate some commands' execution.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Insta485: A Simulation Program for Instagram</strong><br>
            Implemented a static site generator that can automatically produce HTML templates for static web pages.<br>
            Implemented an Instagram clone that has basic Instagram functions with server-side and client-side dynamic
            pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Map - Reduce Searching Engine</strong><br>
            Created a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs.<br>
            Built an Index server, a REST API app that returns search results in JSON format.<br>
            Built a scalable Search server with a user interface that returns search results like Google or Bing.
        </li>
